# WPFMusicPlayer
Soon there's gonna be an awesome music player with modern UI!

-----------------

A long time ago I wrote my first "big" project. It was an audio player written in Python / Qt5.
While doing its job pretty well, the code rapidly became awful to maintain, due to me not having enough experience to 
write such applications by the time.
Now that I've switched to C# / .Net / WPF, I want to rebuild the app from scratch, using all of my knowledge and meanwhile
mastering the MVVM pattern.
