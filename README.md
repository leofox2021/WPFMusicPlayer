# WPFMusicPlayer
Soon there's gonna be an awesome music player with modern UI!

---

A long time ago I wrote my first "big" project. It was an audio player written in Python / Qt5.
While doing its job pretty well, the code rapidly became awful to maintain, 
due to me not having enough experience to write such applications by the time.
Now that I've switched to C# / .Net / WPF, I want to rebuild the app from scratch, 
using all of my knowledge and meanwhile mastering the MVVM pattern.


---

The player uses TagLib C# library for grabbing audio file tags (https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp) 
and .Net Community Toolkit for easier MVVM implementation (https://github.com/CommunityToolkit).

I'm shortly planning to move this audio player to Avalonia framework and
develop it further with it, due to Avalonia being cross platform. This repository will remain public
after the switch.
